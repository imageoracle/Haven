at the front of the ship is a carved wooden head or bust because the stern is called the poop deck not because of people pooping but because the pilot at the wheel would get pooped out 
during the storms.  So when they had to relieve themselves, the sailors would go to the head or the bow of the ship.  since wind blows from back to front the best place would be the head.and the 
best place to relieve themselves.
