The upper most rear of the ship is called a stern or a poop deck.  It is also called the head.  It is located near the rudder to reduce the amount of pullies and ropes needed to steer.
The poop deck was at the top because the captain and pilot have clear view over the top of the ship.  When sailing, the wind comes from the rear.  This is where the Havens steering wheel
is located.  It is actually called La Poupe, it is french for pooped or feeling tired because when sailing in stormy weather, the foam and spray from tall waves would leave the pilot wet.
